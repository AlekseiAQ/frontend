Leverage is a campaign finance tracking app for the city of Philaelphia. It is used to track campaign contributions to candidates within the city of Philadelphia. Our goal is to bring more transparency to how campaigns get financed and show the sources of political contributions.

### Getting Started

Below are the directions for getting the build running on your local machine. I will improve/update the process moving forward since we are still in the Bootstrapping phase.

1. Fork repo > clone repo onto local
2. Run 'npm install' to pull down all packages
3. Use 'npm gulp' to start the build 
4. Use 'npm run tsc:w' to start the transpiling from typescript to JS and the kickoff of the lite server

Follow these steps and it should get you to the application screen.
